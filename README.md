# Password-Generator
_It is a project I created using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**_

It is used to instantly create a secure, random password.
It creates random passwords based on parameters set by you. Parameters include password length, whether the password should be easy to say or read, and whether the password should have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
